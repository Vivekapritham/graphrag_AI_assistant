They were held in the same location during their captivity. The exchange involved both individuals being released at the same time. It is evident that SAMUEL NAMARA and DURKE BATAGLANI share a connection through this shared experience of being hostages and being part of the same exchange. Their bond may have been formed during their time in captivity together, and their release was a significant event that marked the end of their ordeal. The details provided suggest that they were both involved in the same hostage situation and were ultimately freed in a coordinated exchange.
