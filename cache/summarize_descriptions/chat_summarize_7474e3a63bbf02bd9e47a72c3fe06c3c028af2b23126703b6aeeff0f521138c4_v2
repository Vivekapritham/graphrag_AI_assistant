Despite his solitary nature, Scrooge interacts with a portly gentleman who pays a visit to the counting-house. It is mentioned that Scrooge works diligently in the counting-house and has a specific closing time for it. The counting-house serves as a central location where Scrooge conducts his business affairs and manages his finances. Through these interactions and activities in the counting-house, the character of Scrooge is further developed, showcasing his dedication to work and his reluctance to embrace the spirit of Christmas.
