The spectral apparition of Marley's Ghost appears before Scrooge to warn him of the consequences of his selfish and greedy ways. Despite initially dismissing the ghost as a hallucination, Scrooge is ultimately forced to confront the reality of his actions and the impact they have had on those around him.
